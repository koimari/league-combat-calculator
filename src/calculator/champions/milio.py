"""Milio — CP10.4 full-entry-reviewed packet module.

E2 DoT fix: W (Cozy Campfire) heals 25 sourced ticks (Heal per Tick x25 ==
Total Heal) via the heal rule in src/calculator/healing.py.

E8d ally-support: W (Cozy Campfire, Total Heal 70-150 + 15% AP, scope
one_teammate) and R (Breath of Life, Heal 150-350 + 50% AP, scope
self_and_all_teammates) heal allies.  The events are authored by the engine's
ally-support scanner from cached leveling at the cast times; the module
declares W/R in SLOTS so the fight rotation casts them.
