"""Taric — CP10.8 full-entry-reviewed packet module.

E8d ally-support: Q (Starlight's Touch) heals himself and nearby allies per
stocked charge (cached prose: "25 (+ 15% AP) (+ 1% of his maximum health) per
charge"; the cached Q leveling exposes only "Maximum Charges", not a heal
row).  The engine's ally-support scanner cannot author the heal from the
cached leveling, so the Q heal is NOT emitted as a support packet — see E8d
reply for the missing hook.  R (Cosmic Radiance) is invulnerability state
(2.5s), documented as such, not a heal/shield.
